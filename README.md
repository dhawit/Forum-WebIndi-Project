This web development project aims to create a responsive chat website that allows users to communicate with each other in real-time. The website will be designed to work on a variety of devices, from desktop computers to mobile phones, and will prioritize ease of use and user engagement. This project has used a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the website's front-end, while also implementing a back-end system to handle user authentication, chat room creation, and messaging functionality. The goal of this website is to deliver a website that provides a seamless and enjoyable chat experience for users, while also being reliable, secure, and scalable.
Forum is a chat web application which enables users to communicate within the circle of people. It is a website to be used for a group of people to make planes, to talk with all the people at once. This website provides users with the platform to have a cha at the same place to the users so that it is easier for everyone to know about the plan properly and execute on it properly.
Forum holds the feature to change the profile pictures which enables users to identify the other users. Users can post their stories of what they have been doing in their day and make their colleagues and friends updated on their work.
